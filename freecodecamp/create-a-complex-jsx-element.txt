const JSX = (
  <div>
    <h1>Create a Complex JSX Element</h1>
    <p>When rendering multiple elements like this, you can wrap them all in parentheses, but its not strictly required. Also notice this challenge uses a div tag to wrap all the child elements within a single parent element. If you remove the div, the JSX will no longer transpile. Keep this in mind, since it will also apply when you return JSX elements in React components.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>One</li>
      <li>Two</li>
      <li>Three</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
